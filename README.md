# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

>Hand Gesture Recognition using matlab

### This System is a prototype system that helps to recognize hand gesture to normal people in order to communicate more effectively with the specially disabled people like deaf people.
This focuses on the problem of gesture recognition in real time that sign language used by the community of deaf people.
This problem is addressed using **Skin Detection**, **Image Segmentation**,**Image Filtering**, and **Template Matching techniques**.This system recognizes gestures of ASL (AmericanSign Language) including the alphabet.

## Objective

- This system focuses on the problem of gesture recognition in real time that sign language used by the community of deaf people.And uses Color Segmentation,Skin Detection, Image Segmentation, ImageFiltering, and Template Matching techniques like Correlation.
- This system recognizes gestures of ASL including the alphabet.And uses Template matching for matching the gesture to keep it simple,other methods include neural networks.

## Concerns and Limitations

Visibility issue may arise due to several reasons For instance, the camera where the user has to stay in position, the various environmental conditions like lighting sensitivity, background color and condition, electric or magnetic fields or any other disturbance may affect the performance.

- The sitting or standing position of the signer may vary in front of camera. Movements of the signer, like rotating around the body must be taken into account.
- Delay in the processing execution can be occurred due to the large amount or higher resolution of image. Hence, it is difficult to recognize in real time basis.
